1.an estimate of how many hours you spent on the project
I have spent 15 hours on the project

2.a description of how you tested your code

I have tested with by passing sample input text files in the command line argument for example for word count program passed a empty data on the file and analyzed how the output matches with the inbuild wc utility program and passed multiline text content to the wc python program and verified the output with the inbuild wc program.Also I have tested the wc program by passing multiple files in the command line argument along with the wc flag option.

3.any bugs or issues you could not resolve

While implementing the flag option extension for wc program.My program doesn't able to process the command line flag input if mulitple combinations of flags are given to it.At that time it prints all the word,line,character count to the console.

4.an example of a difficult issue or bug and how you resolved it

For the unpack program the process of creating the folders in to the directory was difficult.So I gone through and read the documentation of os module of python to know about how to create the folders and it subdirectories from the python script.

5.a list of the three extensions youâ€™ve chosen to implement, with appropriate detail on them for the CAs to evaluate them

I have implemented two advanced extensions of wc program  that is advanced wc utility of taking multiple files and advanced wc flags to control output.
